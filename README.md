With this device you can measure the density of your beer and send the results to a service via WIFI or Bluetooth. In this user documentation you will learn how to turn on the device, connect it to your WLAN, calibrate it and connect it to a service. Please read these instructions carefully to get the best results from the Hydrom.

For the Hydrom beer brewing sensor, we recommend using the clear water calibration method to begin with. While this method is not as accurate as the reference/sugar method, it is sufficient for relative statements and less laborious. If you want more accuracy, you can always switch to the reference/sugar method. Remember that you must clean the instrument thoroughly before each calibration to obtain accurate results.

We recommend that you use the IOT platform Ubidots for a quick start with the Hydrom beer brewing sensor. Ubidots is a powerful and user-friendly platform that allows you to easily visualize and analyze your measurement data. To use Ubidots, all you need to do is create an account and connect your Hydrom to the platform. Once connected, you'll be able to track the density of your beer in real time and collect all the important information in one place. Give it a try and discover the benefits of Ubidots for yourself!

Have fun brewing!
