2.  The Hydrom must be in configuration mode\
    In normal operation, no user interface is loaded in order not to waste the battery charge. Therefore, the Hydrom must be put into configuration mode.

    You can detect if the Hydrom is in Deepsleep when the green LED is on as described here: [#1-status-led-of-the-hydrom-logic](indicator-leds.md#1-status-led-of-the-hydrom-logic "mention")

    If the Hydrom is in Deepsleep, it can be woken up according to the instructions on this page:\
    [wakeup-the-hydrom.md](wakeup-the-hydrom.md "mention")
