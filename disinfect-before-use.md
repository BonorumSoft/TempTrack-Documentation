## Disinfect before use

To properly disinfect your Hydrom, start by thoroughly cleaning it with hot water and a mild detergent. Once it is clean, you can use a disinfectant solution or wipes to kill any remaining bacteria and germs. Be sure to follow the instructions on the disinfectant product you are using, as some may require you to let the solution sit for a certain amount of time before rinsing it off.

It is also a good idea to regularly disinfect your Hydrom, especially if it is used frequently or if it has come into contact with any potentially contaminated substances. By keeping your Hydrom clean and disinfected, you can help ensure that your food and beverages are safe to consume.
