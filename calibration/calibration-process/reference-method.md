{% hint style="success" %}
**Precondition:**

1. User interface Access\
   To make this setting you must have access to the user interface. If this is not the case, see here how to do it:[access-to-the-user-interface.md](../../readme/access-to-the-user-interface.md "mention")
2. Equipment needed:
   1. Density verification meter
   2. Reference liquid (can be beer in the brewing process)
{% endhint %}

## Step 3: Select reference method

## Step 4: Perform the measurements.

### Session 1: 0° Brix/Plato solution

Create a 0° Brix solution by placing clear water (20°C) in a vessel.

Place the Hydrom in the vessel with the water.

When the instrument floats calmly, enter "0" in the Plato field and confirm by pressing "continue".

### Session 2: 20° Brix/Plato solution

Create a 20° Brix solution by mixing 1816g of the solution from Pass 1 with 454g of sugar.

Place the Hydrom in the vessel containing the mixture.

When it is floating calmly and the sugar has completely dissolved then enter "20" in the Plato field and confirm by pressing "continue".

### Session 3: 15° Brix/Plato solution

Create a 15° Brix solution by mixing 1668g of the solution from Pass 2 with 556g of water.

Place the hydrom in the vessel containing the mixture.

When it is floating calmly then enter "15" in the Plato field and confirm by pressing "continue".

### Session 4: 10° Brix/Plato Solution

Create a 10° Brix solution by mixing 1453g of the solution from Pass 3 with 727g of water.

Place the hydrom in the vessel containing the mixture.

When it is floating calmly then enter "10" in the Plato field and confirm by pressing "continue".

### Session 5: 7.5° Brix/Plato solution

Create a 7.5° Brix solution by mixing 1619g of the solution from Pass 4 with 540g of water.

Place the hydrom in the vessel containing the mixture.

When it is floating calmly then enter "7.5" in the Plato field and confirm by pressing "continue".

### Session 6: 5° Brix/Plato solution

Create a 5° Brix solution by mixing 1425g of the solution from Pass 5 with 713g of water.

Place the hydrom in the vessel containing the mixture.

When it is floating calmly then enter "5" in the Plato field and confirm by pressing "continue".

### Session 7: 2.5° Brix/Plato solution

Create a 2.5° Brix solution by mixing 1058g of the solution from Pass 6 with 1058g of water.

Place the hydrom in the vessel containing the mixture.

When it is floating calmly then enter "2.5" in the Plato field and confirm by pressing "continue".

## Step 5: Confirm the results

The formula has been calculated and the measured values are displayed in the table. After confirmation the new values are saved in the settings.

## The calibration is completed
